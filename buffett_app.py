    ### Ask questions from all of Warren Buffett's annual shareholder letters dating back to 1977

    These letters are much anticipated by investors for the wealth of knowledge that Buffett provides.
    The tool allows you to interact with these letters by asking questions and a LLM is used to find relevant answers.

    **Example questions to ask:**
    
    - How does your view on managing investment risk differ from professional investment managers?
    - What was your gain in net worth in 1984?
    - What are some of your biggest lessons learned?
    - What do you look for in managers?
    - Are markets efficient? Give a specific example that you have used in a letter.
